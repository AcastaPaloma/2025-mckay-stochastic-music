# 🎶 Stochastic Music Generator Project

**Goal:**
Create a program that **generates original, 2+ minute-long music** every time it runs — using **stochastic (random/probabilistic)** methods.
You can generate either **MIDI** or **audio** output. The goal is to make the music sound **interesting and unique** every time.

## 🧠 What This Project Is About

You’ll explore the intersection of:

* 🎲 **Randomness** — generating melodies, rhythms, and harmonies via probability.
* 🎵 **Music Theory** — how to make random music still sound “musical.”
* 💻 **Generative Programming** — writing code that creates art.

## 🪜 Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Format

You can choose either approach:

* **MIDI-based:** Easier to start with, can be played back with many instruments.
* **Audio-based:** More advanced; involves waveform or sample synthesis.

---

### 2. Pick Your Tools

#### 🧩 For MIDI Generation:

* **[`mido`](https://mido.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** — for creating and saving MIDI files.
* **[`music21`](https://web.mit.edu/music21/)** — a full-featured library for algorithmic composition and analysis.
* **[`Mingus`](https://bspaans.github.io/python-mingus/)** — good for theory and structure.

#### 🎧 For Audio Generation:

* **[`pydub`](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)** — for sound manipulation.
* **[`scamp`](https://scamp.marcevanstein.com/)** — for live audio rendering of stochastic compositions.
* **[`pyo`](https://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/)** — powerful real-time synthesis library.

### 3. Start Simple

Here’s a suggested roadmap:

1. **Random Notes:** Generate a sequence of random notes from a scale.
2. **Random Rhythm:** Add probabilistic durations and rests.
3. **Structure:** Define sections (intro, verse, chorus, etc.) with different rules.
4. **Harmony:** Add chord progressions or harmonic probability.
5. **Instrument Layers:** Add melody, bassline, percussion, etc.
6. **Export:** Save to `.mid` or `.wav`.

### 4. Example Idea

> Generate a 2-minute piano piece where each note’s pitch and duration are chosen based on weighted probabilities (e.g., prefer consonant intervals, favor longer durations in slower sections).

Or try:

* Markov chains for note transitions.
* Perlin noise for dynamic variation.
* Cellular automata to control rhythm.
* Genetic algorithms to evolve melodies.

## 🧩 Example Pseudocode

```python
import random
from mido import Message, MidiFile, MidiTrack

notes = [60, 62, 64, 65, 67, 69, 71, 72]  # C major scale
durations = [240, 480, 960]  # 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 notes

mid = MidiFile()
track = MidiTrack()
mid.tracks.append(track)

time_elapsed = 0
while time_elapsed < 2 * 60 * 480:  # 2 minutes (in ticks)
    note = random.choice(notes)
    duration = random.choice(durations)
    velocity = random.randint(60, 110)

    track.append(Message('note_on', note=note, velocity=velocity, time=0))
    track.append(Message('note_off', note=note, velocity=velocity, time=duration))
    time_elapsed += duration

mid.save('stochastic_piece.mid')
# yeah no, do NOT submit this, it'll be so bad :3
```
